## Who we are

We're a small, queer-friendly group of rope enthusiasts, building a friendly and respectful environment for exploring rope safely and openly.

Whether you're brand new or have years of experience, you're welcome at RopeLabs! We're hoping to be at Congress, EMF, CCCamp, Bornhack, and other similar hacker camps.

Want to hang with us? Send a message so we can get you in the group chat, or just turn up and ask.

## What we offer

We host beginner lessons, peer-to-peer support, and open rope jams.

Our goal is to share skills and create a supportive space for people interested in rope—especially those who are queer, curious, or completely new to it.

Come talk to us any time to learn more!

Please **don't interrupt people who are actively tying**, questions are welcome once the tie is over and participants have had a moment to decompress.

## Guidelines

RopeLabs is a queer-friendly, sex-positive, and inclusive environment.

* Consent comes first. Always ask before touching, tying, or photographing someone.
* No sexual activity - our public events are non-sexual.
* Minimum clothing is required at all times.
* Respect personal space and boundaries.
* Shoes off on any of the matting or carpet.
* Take care of each other. If you’re unsure, ask.
* Outside of safety or consent concerns, do not interrupt other people's scenes<sup>*</sup>
* Explicit permission from one of the organisers must be given before you can make use of our suspension frame

<sup>*</sup>Ideally grab one of the RopeLabs team if you have a specific safety or consent concerns. Our team are trained safety monitors and can make a good assessment of the risk.
