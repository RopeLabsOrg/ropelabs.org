## 👥 Who we are

We are a small, queer-friendly group of rope bondage (shibari) enthusiasts. We build a friendly, respectful space to explore rope safely, learn together, and support each other.

Whether you're brand new or have years of experience, you're welcome at RopeLabs! We mostly run spaces at European hacker camps and community events. Recent events include EMF, Bornhack, FriedCamp, WHY2025, and Congress.

Want to hang with us? Send a message (via [Fetlife](https://fetlife.com/RopeLabs) or [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@RopeLabs)) so we can get you a group chat, or find us at an event and ask.

## 🎪 What we offer

We host beginner lessons, peer-to-peer support, and open rope jams.

Our goal is to share skills and create a supportive space for people interested in rope, whether you're completely new, rope curious, or a shibari master.

Our events welcome complete beginners, experienced riggers, rope bottoms, switches, self-tyers, and curious onlookers. You can come solo, with a partner or group. You are always free to just watch, ask questions, and opt out of any activity.

Come talk to us any time to learn more!

## 🎭 What it's like to attend

When you arrive at a RopeLabs event, you'll find a welcoming space where people tie, watch, chat, and decompress. You can say hi to the organisers to get oriented, or simply find a spot to observe.

People engage in rope scenes, practice techniques, and share knowledge. Organisers keep an eye on safety throughout. You can participate as much or as little as you want, watching is completely fine, and you can leave at any time.

## 🛒 Rope & Safety Kit

At events, we often have rope and safety equipment available to take home on a donation basis. Outside of events, we have a list of places we recommend purchasing from, including our own rope space.

[See our rope and safety kit guide →](/rope-and-safety-kit)

## 🧑‍🏫 Where to learn more?

We strongly recommend you find your closest rope space, peer rope or munch and visit in person. If this is not possible, there are plenty of good websites with online tutorials.

## 📋 Guidelines

These rules exist to keep everyone safe and relaxed.

RopeLabs is a queer-friendly, sex-positive, and inclusive environment.

### During scenes

- Consent comes first. Always ask before touching, tying, or photographing someone.
- No sexual activity. Our public events are non-sexual spaces.
- Outside of safety or consent concerns, do not interrupt other people's scenes.
- Do not interrupt a scene unless you see a clear safety or consent issue.<sup>\*</sup>

<sup>\*</sup>Ideally grab one of the RopeLabs team if you have a specific safety or consent concern. Our team are experienced safety monitors and can help assess the risk.

### In shared space

- Respect personal space and boundaries.
- Wear what you want, though loose-fitting clothes may get in the way when tying.
- A minimum level of coverage is required at all times, as might be expected in a gym.
- Shoes off on any matting or carpet.
- Take care of each other. If you are unsure, ask an organiser or experienced community member.
- You must have explicit permission from one of the organisers before using our suspension frame.
- Keep cutting equipment suitable for rope within arms reach.
