## 🎪 Current Event: [39C3](39c3.html)

We are an assembly at 39C3 (Chaos Communication Congress) in Hamburg. We're running bondage workshops and a rope jam together with [KinkyGeeks.de](https://kinkygeeks.de), and we'll have rope and safety equipment for sale on a donation basis.

[See our 39C3 page for details →](39c3.html)

## Who we are

We are a small, queer-friendly group of rope bondage (shibari) enthusiasts. We build a friendly, respectful space to explore rope safely, learn together, and support each other.

Whether you're brand new or have years of experience, you're welcome at RopeLabs! We mostly run spaces at European hacker camps and community events.
Recent events include EMF, Bornhack, FriedCamp, WHY2025, and Congress.

Want to hang with us? Send a message (via [Fetlife](https://fetlife.com/RopeLabs) or [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@RopeLabs)) so we can get you a group chat, or find us at an event and ask.

## What we offer

We host beginner lessons, peer-to-peer support, and open rope jams.

Our goal is to share skills and create a supportive space for people interested in rope, whether you're completely new, rope curious, or a shibari master.

Our events welcome complete beginners, experienced riggers, rope bottoms, switches, self-tyers, and curious onlookers. You can come solo, with a partner or group. You are always free to just watch, ask questions, and opt out of any activity.

Come talk to us any time to learn more!

Please **don't interrupt people who are actively tying**, questions are welcome once the tie is over and participants have had a moment to decompress.

## Guidelines

RopeLabs is a queer-friendly, sex-positive, and inclusive environment.

### Consent and behaviour

- Consent comes first. Always ask before touching, tying, or photographing someone.
- No sexual activity. Our public events are non-sexual spaces.
- Respect personal space and boundaries.
- Outside of safety or consent concerns, do not interrupt other people's scenes.

### Clothing and space

- Minimum clothing is required at all times, in line with event rules.
- Shoes off on any matting or carpet.
- Take care of each other. If you are unsure, ask an organiser or experienced community member.

### Safety and equipment

- Do not interrupt a scene unless you see a clear safety or consent issue.<sup>*</sup>
- You must have explicit permission from one of the organisers before using our suspension frame.

<sup>*</sup>Ideally grab one of the RopeLabs team if you have a specific safety or consent concern. Our team are experienced safety monitors and can help assess the risk.
