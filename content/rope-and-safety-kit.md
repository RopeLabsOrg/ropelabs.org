# Rope & Safety Kit

We don't sell rope or safety equipment, but here's a guide to help you find quality gear from trusted suppliers.

## What to look for

We focus on ropes that handle well for shibari and kinbaku.

### Rope types

- **Ogawa Jute · 6 mm**  
  Hand treated Japanese jute with a smooth, responsive feel.

- **POSH · 5 mm**  
  Low-stretch, washable synthetic that handles like natural rope, known working limit.

- **Natural jute or hemp**
  - Classic kinbaku look and feel.
  - Lighter in the hand.
  - Needs more care, airing, and checking.

- **POSH and other "natural-behaving" synthetics**
  - Tough and low-maintenance.
  - Washable, good for sweaty jams and frequent practice.
  - Slightly different feel but very forgiving for newer riggers.
  - Known and measured working limit, good for suspension work.

Stuck on how to choose? Natural rope is the high-end Japanese carbon steel blade. It needs care, but rewards you with feel, performance, and beauty. POSH or Hempex is the stainless steel workhorse. It handles rough use and you can throw it in the wash without worry. Both "cut" the same, so it comes down to what you enjoy looking after and working with.

### Starter bundles

For most students we'd suggest a simple starter kit:

- **Three matching 8m lengths** so your handling stays consistent.
- A pair of safety shears and you have everything needed to practice safely.

## Safety gear

Rope is replaceable. **Your partner is not.**

Bring proper safety cutters for **every** scene.
Keep them in an easy-to-grab place that **both** riggers and partner(s) are aware of.

Good options for cutting rope safely include:

- Trauma or EMT shears
- Rock-climbing or rescue shears
- Other blunt-tipped cutters made to slice rope fast

**Test your scissors** on a spare piece of your own rope. One firm, committed squeeze should give a clean cut. If it does not, upgrade your tool.

## Where to buy

We're slowly building a list of places we recommend. Opening an [issue](https://github.com/ropelabsorg/ropelabs.org/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/ropelabsorg/ropelabs.org/pulls) on [GitHub](https://github.com/ropelabsorg/ropelabs.org) for the team to review is encouraged!
