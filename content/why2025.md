## Village & Workshops Sobriety Rule

To ensure the safety and comfort of everyone, please be aware that entering the village requires sobriety.

This guideline helps us maintain a secure environment where all attendees can relax, share ideas and connect.

## Village Opening Hours

**SPECIAL OPENING HOURS FOR Tuesday:** 1pm-4pm, after which village teardown starts.

We may be open a bit after teardown. Anyone who has some time to help will be much appreciated.

**Normal opening hours:**

* 2pm - 5pm
* 7pm - Midnight (Except during our workshop or rope jam)

Please respect these times so we're able to able to take some moments to ourselves.

## Where can you find us?

You can find us at the [north field near the tree line](https://map.why2025.org/#17.97/52.692378/4.744992&maphash=19.82/52.6923585/4.7443724/-20), on the left side of the field.

It's a shaded and slightly secluded spot, but still easy to access through the trees.

## Guidelines

RopeLabs is a queer-friendly, sex-positive, and inclusive environment.

* Consent comes first. Always ask before touching, tying, or photographing someone.
* No sexual activity - everything at this event is non-sexual.
* Minimum clothing is required at all times.
* Respect personal space and boundaries.
* Shoes off on any of the matting or carpet.
* Take care of each other. If you're unsure, ask.
* Outside of safety or consent concerns, do not interrupt other people's scenes<sup>*</sup>
* Explicit permission from one of the village organisers must be given before you can make use of the suspension frame

<sup>*</sup>Ideally grab one of the RopeLabs team if you have a specific safety or consent concerns. Our team are trained safety monitors and can make a good assessment of the risk.

## Equipment & Facilities

  * Space to spectate others tie
  * A small amount of practice rope (also for sale)
  * A suspension frame - ask permission to use

  * Bring a blanket or cushion for sitting comfortably on the ground
  * Your own non-stretchy rope (we may have some to borrow)
  * Expect shoes-off areas and chill zones

## Rope for Sale

We have sets of 8m rope for sale at near cost of production. Please donate what you can afford. Prices listed are our costs.

It will be on sale **at the end** of our **Saturday 7pm workshop** for people that attend, or **after 11am on Sunday** at our village.

* Ogawa Jute - high end treated rope 6mm - €15/8m
* POSH - synthetic 6mm - €15/8m
* Normal Jute - older rougher untreated jute 6mm - €8m/8m

Ask for Pez (4PEZ) or Laura (BBYG).

### Rope Treatment

For people that purchased some of our rope, this is what you need to know:

#### POSH

POSH needs near zero treatment - it'll become softer to work with the more that you use it.

If you want to speed up this process you can run it back and forth through a carabiner or around some metal.

#### Jute

We've sell two kinds of jute: high-end Ogawa Jute from Japan and lower-quality jute from the Netherlands.

While we've already partially pre-treated the ropes to soften them and reduce loose or scratchy fibers.

To finish the rope, we like to:

* Apply a small amount of natural oil (for example, jojoba, camellia or mineral oil) to keep fibers supple
* Optionally seal it with a light wax layer.
* With regular use, your rope will soften further from natural body oils.

If you Google "how to treat jute rope", you'll see lots of conflicting advice - flaming it, baking it in an oven, breaking it in with carabiners, roughing it up, or even washing it in a washing machine. Here's what we've learned from testing ropes until they break:

* Getting natural fibers wet weakens them over time.
* Burning, singeing or getting the fibers too hot reduces strength.
* Breaking in the rope (pulling it over something rough or frictioning it aggressively) literally breaks up the fibers and weakens the structure.

That's why we suggest doing as little as possible — just treat it gently — and let it age into softness through use.

**Of note:** like most jute from Japan, our jute was processed with jute batching oil (JBO) so has a light smell. It's generally considered safe for humans but there are mixed reports of skin irritation or other problems, online. We've partially processed the rope to remove most of the oil, but leaving it to hang and dry will help the remainder make its way out. Along with treating it.

For extra context, here are a few more methods people recommend online:

* Letting the rope air-dry on a curtain rail and gently wiping it with your hands to help remove fuzz and balance the strands.
* Lightly singeing the rope over a blue flame (like a gas burner) to burn off fuzzies — though this can darken the rope and requires care.
* Using tumble drying (with no water) combined with rope butter and light flame singe, followed by jojoba oil, then air-drying.
* Wiping the rope with jojoba oil on a rag, rubbing with beeswax, then hanging to dry.

All of these methods can work — just know they trade some rope strength for softness and look. We prefer a lighter touch.

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like help choosing a method or troubleshooting.
