# RopeLabs at 39C3

We're an assembly 39C3 (Congress). We’re working with [KinkyGeeks.de](https://kinkygeeks.de) to run beginner bondage workshops, host a rope jam, and provide safe, accessible rope practice throughout Congress.

## 🎪 What's happening

At our assembly, you can:

- Attend [beginner-friendly bondage workshops](#workshops-rope-jam) run with KinkyGeeks
- Join an [open rope jam](#workshops-rope-jam) to tie, be tied, or observe
- Buy [rope and safety equipment](#rope-safety-kit-for-sale) on a pay-what-you-want basis, which helps fund workshops and shared gear
- Drop by during our [opening hours](#opening-hours) with questions or to nerd about rope
