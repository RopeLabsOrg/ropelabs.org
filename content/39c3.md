# RopeLabs at 39C3

We're an assembly 39C3 (Congress). We’re working with [KinkyGeeks.de](https://kinkygeeks.de) to run beginner bondage workshops, host a rope jam, and provide safe, accessible rope practice throughout Congress.

## 🎪 What's happening at RopeLabs

At our assembly, you can:

- Attend [**beginner-friendly bondage workshops**](#workshops-rope-jam) run with KinkyGeeks
- Join an [**open rope jam**](#workshops-rope-jam) to tie, be tied, or observe
- Buy [**rope and safety equipment**](#rope-safety-kit-for-sale) on a pay-what-you-want basis, which helps fund workshops and shared gear

### ⭐ Favourite our workshops

Room allocation is partially based on the number of favourites.

**Please favourite any RopeLabs workshops you want to attend.**  
Without enough favourites, we will not get a room and the workshops cannot run.

[bondage](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/tag/bondage), or using the links above.

## 🎓 Workshops & Rope Jam

**These times are proposed and not yet final.**
