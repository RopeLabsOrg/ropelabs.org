# RopeLabs at 39C3

We're an assembly 39C3 (Congress). We’re working with [KinkyGeeks.de](https://kinkygeeks.de) to run beginner bondage workshops, host a rope jam, and provide safe, accessible rope practice throughout Congress.

## 🎪 What's happening

At our assembly, you can:

- Attend [beginner-friendly bondage workshops](#workshops-rope-jam) run with KinkyGeeks
- Join an [open rope jam](#workshops-rope-jam) to tie, be tied, or observe
- Take home [rope and safety equipment](#rope-safety-kit-for-sale) on a pay-what-you-want basis, which helps fund workshops and shared gear
- Drop by with questions or to nerd about rope

<!--

- No sexual activity. Everything at this event is non-sexual.

- Outside of safety or consent concerns, do not interrupt other people's scenes.

### Clothing and space

These spikes slide onto rope and create sharp pressure points that dig into the skin. For those who enjoy more intense sensation.
