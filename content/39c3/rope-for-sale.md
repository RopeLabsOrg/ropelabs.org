Ask at the assembly if you want us to set rope aside, or find us after workshops and jams.

## How to take or reserve

Find us at the RopeLabs assembly **starting from 4:30pm on day 1:**

- **After** workshops.
- During rope jams.

No-one home? Message us on [mastodon](https://chaos.social/@RopeLabs) or you can call our DECT on JUTE (5883) or HEMP (4367).

All rope and safety equipment is being given on a **first come, first served basis**.

We will need to **hold back some of our rope stock** until after all of our workshops to ensure we have enough for participants, so check back on day 3 if we're out of stock when you visit.


### Pay-what-you-want (donation basis)

All rope and safety equipment is offered on a **pay-what-you-want (donation) basis**.

The amounts listed above reflect our actual costs - this is what we ask for to cover our expenses and reasonable labour. However, please donate what you can afford. We want to make rope accessible to everyone, regardless of financial situation.

Any money donated beyond our costs goes to the RopeLabs organization to fund future events and activities, not to individuals.

### Starter bundles

For most students we'd suggest a simple starter kit:

- **Three matching 8m lengths** so your handling stays consistent.
- A pair of safety shears and you have everything needed to practice safely.

If you are not sure whether to pick jute, POSH, or a mix, we are happy to talk it through based on how you tie and who you tie with.

## Rope choices in short

Here is the quick version if you just want to decide and go:

- **Natural jute or hemp**
  - Classic kinbaku look and feel.
  - Lighter in the hand.
  - Needs more care, airing, and checking.

- **POSH and other "natural-behaving" synthetics**
  - Tough and low-maintenance.
  - Washable, good for sweaty jams and frequent practice.
  - Slightly different feel but very forgiving for newer riggers.
  - Known and measured working limit, good for suspension work.

Stuck on how to choose? Natural rope is the high-end Japanese carbon steel blade. It needs care, but rewards you with feel, performance, and beauty. POSH or Hempex is the stainless steel workhorse. It handles rough use and you can throw it in the wash without worry. Both “cut” the same, so it comes down to what you enjoy looking after and working with.

Not sure what suits your hands, body, or play style?  
Find us at the assembly and we will happily nerd out about rope with you.

## Safety gear

Rope is replaceable. **Your partner is not.**  

Bring proper safety cutters for **every** scene.
Keep them in an easy-to-grab place that **both** riggers and partner(s) are aware of.

Good options for cutting rope safely include:

- Trauma or EMT shears
- Rock-climbing or rescue shears
- Other blunt-tipped cutters made to slice rope fast

**Test your scissors** on a spare piece of your own rope. One firm, committed squeeze should give a clean cut. If it does not, upgrade your tool.

## Rope Spikes

We have shibari rope spikes available in two styles:

### Print Spikes

These spikes leave a decorative print or logo on your skin when pressed against it with rope. Perfect for adding visual interest to your scenes.

We have two designs available:

- **Fairydust (C3 Rocket)**  
- **Kitty**  

### Standard Spikes

These spikes slide onto rope and create sharp pressure points that dig into the skin. For those who enjoy more intense sensation.

All rope spikes are offered on the same **pay-what-you-want (donation) basis** as our other equipment. Our cost to produce was **€1**. 


### Receipts

As everything is on a donation basis, receipts are not available.
If you need one for your records, we can arrange a charge with VAT.
