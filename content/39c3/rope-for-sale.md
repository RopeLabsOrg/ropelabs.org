## How to buy or reserve

Find us at the RopeLabs assembly during 39c3:

- During [assembly opening hours](/39c3).
- After workshops.
- During rope jams.

All rope and safety equipment is sold on a **first come, first served basis**. We will need to **hold back some of our rope stock** until after all of our workshops and rope jam to ensure we have enough for participants, so check back after those if we're out of stock when you visit.

### Pay-what-you-want (donation basis)

All rope and safety equipment is offered on a **pay-what-you-want (donation) basis**. The amounts listed above reflect our actual costs - this is what we ask for to cover our expenses and reasonable labour. However, please donate what you can afford. We want to make rope accessible to everyone, regardless of financial situation.

Any money donated beyond our costs goes to the RopeLabs organization to fund future events and activities, not to individuals.

### Starter bundles

For most students we'd suggest a simple starter kit:

- **Three matching 8m lengths** so your handling stays consistent.
- Add a pair of safety shears and you have everything needed to practice safely between classes.

If you are not sure whether to pick jute, POSH, or a mix, we are happy to talk it through based on how you tie and who you tie with.

## Rope choices in short

Here is the quick version if you just want to decide and go:

- **Natural jute or hemp**
  - Classic kinbaku look and feel.
  - Lighter in the hand.
  - Needs more care, airing, and checking.

- **POSH and other "natural-behaving" synthetics**
  - Tough and low-maintenance.
  - Washable, good for sweaty jams and frequent practice.
  - Slightly different feel but very forgiving for newer riggers.

Not sure what suits your hands, body, or play style?  
Find us at the assembly and we will happily nerd out about rope with you.

## Safety gear

Rope is replaceable. Your partner is not.  
We expect proper safety cutters in the room for every scene.

We normally keep a small stock of basic EMT / trauma shears at the assembly, so you can grab a pair with your rope.

Good options for cutting rope safely include:

- Trauma or EMT shears.
- Rock-climbing or rescue shears.
- Other blunt-tipped cutters made to slice rope fast.

Test your scissors on a spare piece of your own rope.  
One firm, committed squeeze should give a clean cut. If it does not, upgrade your tool and keep it in a fixed, easy-to-grab place that both partners know about.

### Receipts

As everything is on a donation basis, receipts are not available.
If you need one for your records, we can arrange a charge with VAT.
